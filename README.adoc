== Summary
THIS IS JUST A PROTOTYPE FOR NOW!

=== Why?
Latest after creating AI images using my https://github.com/cbaoth/userscripts#invoke-ai-tweaks[invoke-ai-tweaks] userscript I have a pretty big mess of images with random prompts, samplers, sizes, etc.

=== What it does already
* Read all metadata from https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI[InvokeAI] PNG files
* Store this metadata in a Sqlite DB

=== What I want it to do
* Identify similarities between multiple image prompts, e.g. after organizing/rating them, which prompts work and which don't (to achive the best goals)
* Organize/rename image files based on their similarities, e.g. group images with similar prompts
