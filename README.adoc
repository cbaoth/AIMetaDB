== Summary
THIS IS JUST A PROTOTYPE FOR NOW!

* HACKY PROTOTYPE CODE!
* NO TESTS YET!
* NO GUARANTEES REGARDING BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (DB, OUTPUT FORMAT, ARGUMENTS, ETC.)!
* ...

=== What's the idea behind this?
Latest after creating AI images using my https://github.com/cbaoth/userscripts#invoke-ai-tweaks[invoke-ai-tweaks] userscript or other "mass production randomness madness" in https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI[InvokeAI] and https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui[Automatic1111], I got a pretty big mess of images with random prompts, samplers, sizes, etc. that are hard to sort/group plus I have no convenient way finding out which prompts and settings have the highest impact on good results.

Main goals, means to ..

* .. read png AI engine metadata from files *&rarr; Done*
* .. rename files based on meta data like model_weihts, sampler, seed, file creation date, etc. *&rarr; Done*
* .. create a DB (cache) of existing files to make matching new files against existing ones more efficient *&rarr; Done*
* .. identify image similarities based on their metadata (e.g. similar prompts) *&rarr; Partially done*
** To identify most promissing settings _(see what works and what doesn't)_
** To manually identify differences that mostly impact the result/style of images that have atherwise similar settings/prompts.
* .. output metadata and similarities in basic CSV format *&rarr; Done*
* .. output metadata and similarities in in (colorful/formated) diff mode (e.g. HTML)
* .. group images into folders based on metadata

=== What it does already
* Read most metadata from https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI[InvokeAI] and https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui[Automatic1111] PNG files _(files with missing details are skipped)_
** _Icluduse additional information like AI engine, unique image data hash code, etc._
* `--mode UPDATEDB`: Store, upate, read this metadata in/from a SQLite DB
* `--mode RENAME`: Rename wiles baesd on this metadata (custom pattern and dry-run support). _Example:_
** Pattern: `{file_ctime_iso}_{model_hash_short}-{seed}-{image_hash_short}_[{cfg_scale}@{steps}, {sampler}]`
** Renames: `/mnt/i/sd/Output/Photo/Stock/001313.019f7f7b.2956399993.png` &rarr; `/mnt/i/sd/Output/Photo/Stock/2023-01-16T14:06:16.602398_d8691b4d16-2956399993-5a854aa551_[7.5@20, k_euler_a].png`
* `--mode MATCHDB`: Find similarities between prompt texts from the DB vs. those of provided reference images _(result grouped by input files)_.
** _Currently just a simple Levenshtein Distance metric (0 to 100) for the prompt._
* `--mode TOJSON`: Print metadata of one or more files as json.
** Example: `./main.py --mode TOJSON ai_image.png | jq .prompt` -> Get prompt only
* `--mode TOCSV`: Print metadata of one or more files as csv.

=== Some ideas (not yet implemented)
* Directly match arg files w/o using the cache db
* Organize files into folders based on metadat
* Alternative formated (e.g. HTML) output allowing things like general formating, diff visualization, colors, images/thumbnails (local ref / thumbnails stored in DB)

== Requirements

Python 3.8+ and the following pips:

 # https://pillow.readthedocs.io/ - to read png metadata
 pip install pillow

 # https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz - to find prompt similarities using  Levenshtein Distance
 pip install "thefuzz[speedup]"

== Usage

Pretty basic (still a prototype):

=== Parse and output file metadata

Metadata to JSON:

 ./main.py --mode TOJSON my_image.png

Metadata to CSV (basic, pipe separated):

 ./main.py --mode TOJSON my_image.png

Metadata to key-value in format "key: value" (one line per key, newlines stripped from value):

 ./main.py --mode TOKEYVALUE my_image.png

The latter can be used in combination with the link:AITools.ahk[] AutoHotkey (v2) script:

1. Run link:to-keyvalue.bat[] with a single png file as argument (e.g. via Hotkey in https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/[XnView NP]) to put meta into the clipboard, or copy meta from various websites.
2. Open A1111 or InvokeAI _(the latter being only partially supported)_ in the browser, focus the prompt textarea, and press `F10` to fill the form fields with the values from the clipboard meta.

_Note that this solution is pretty basic, has some flaws and limitations, especially due to the fact that Tab is used to naviate the form, which heavily relies on matching tab-indexes, tab not being otherwise intercepted, and fields being accessible/visible/editable._

=== Transfer PNG metadata into DB
Scan invoke-ai png file metadata into the DB (insert new, update existing records, based on hash code):

 ./main.py --recursive "sd/output/**/*.png"

on windows with more verbose output:

 python main.py --recursive --loglevel_cl INFO "D:\sd\output\**\*.png"


=== Match file prompt against DB
Scan one or more png files comparing them with the db file prompts:

 ./main.py --mode MATCHDB --similarity_min 90 --sort_matches --loglevel_cl NONE sd/000016.b6a7a640.700956471.png

A result for a single reference file might look like this (without colors and images):

`in_file_idx | db_file_idx | **file_source** | **similarity** | steps | cfg_scale | sampler | height | width | seed | model_hash | model_weights | type | image_hash | file_name | app_id | app_version | **prompt**`
