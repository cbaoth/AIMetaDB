== Summary
THIS IS JUST A PROTOTYPE FOR NOW!

FOR NOW I'LL NOT ENSURE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN VERSION, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE DB!

=== Why do this?
Latest after creating AI images using my https://github.com/cbaoth/userscripts#invoke-ai-tweaks[invoke-ai-tweaks] userscript or other "mass production randomness madness" I have a pretty big mess of images with random prompts, samplers, sizes, etc. that are hard to sort/group and its hard to find out which settings and prompts work more than others.

Main goals, means to ..
* .. create a DB with all my Invoke-AI PNG files (image hash based).
* .. find, group, etc. images based on metadata like promt content.
* .. find, group, etc. images based on metadata similarities (e.g. similar prompts)
** To find most promising settings (see what works and what doesn't).
** To manually identify differences that mostly impact the result/style of images that have atherwise similar settings/prompts.

=== What it does already
* **Read all metadata from https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI[InvokeAI] PNG files**
** *Metadata of other engines is not supported (yet), files with missing metadata will just be ignored.*
* **Store this metadata in a Sqlite DB**
** *Includes the current file name (may change) and a sha256 hash of the image data only (no metadata). I don't want actual image hashes (similarity) but a has for a given file to identify it again later on. It has to be seen if this approch is stable or not.*
** All metadat is additionally stored as a json for future processing of properties that are yet unknown to the app or not specifically collected (field based, into DB columns).
* **Find similarities between prompt texts from the DB and those of provided reference images.**
** *Currently just a simple Levenshtein Distance metric (0 to 100).*

=== What I want it to do
* Identify similarities between multiple image prompts, e.g. after organizing/rating them, which prompts work and which don't (to achive the best goals)
* Organize/rename image files based on their similarities, e.g. group images with similar prompts

=== What

== Requirements

Python 3.8+ and the following pips:

 # https://pillow.readthedocs.io/ - to read png metadata
 pip install pillow

 # https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz - to find prompt similarities using  Levenshtein Distance
 pip install "thefuzz[speedup]"

== Usage

Pretty basic (still a prototype):

=== Transfer PNG metadata into DB
Scan invoke-ai png file metadata into the DB (insert new, update existing records, based on hash code):

 ./main.py --recursive "sd/output/**/*.png"

on windows with more verbose output:

 python main.py --recursive --loglevel_cl INFO "D:\sd\output\**\*.png"

=== Match file prompt against DB
* Scan one or more png files comparing them with the db file prompts:

 ./main.py --mode MATCHDB --similarity_min 90 --sort_matches --loglevel_cl NONE sd/000016.b6a7a640.700956471.png

A result for a single reference file might look like this (without colors and images):

`in_file_idx | db_file_idx | **file_source** | **similarity** | steps | cfg_scale | sampler | height | width | seed | model_hash | model_weights | type | image_hash | file_name | app_id | app_version | **prompt**`

Per default the DB `ai_meta.db` and log `ai_meta.log` file are located inside the user's `$HOME` dircetory or `%userprofile%` on windows.
